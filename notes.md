"facilitate" suggestion doesn't work (_ease_ or _help_)

"inbumbent upon" suggestion doesn't work (_must_)
    - i.e. `It's incumbent on them` should go to `They must`

"Innovative" is part of OCSIT

clarify "citizens" prompt

remove "there is" — ?

dialogue — sometimes technical

"your office" --> "your" often doesn't work

"collaborate" --> "working with" doesn't parse the same (should be "work together" or other)

false positives for "drop-down" correction

gendered pronoun correction should NOT suggest "it"

no problem with `he'll` if correct for that person
